title: Python - Building Django Apps
---


<div class="D_bbcode">
 Building apps in Django is a lot of fun! <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-fox-24554110/">Ryan Fox</a> and I gave a presentation on Django basics at the MKE Python meetup. <a href="https://www.meetup.com/MKE-Python-Meetup/events/242451707">WebDev: Building Django Apps</a> <br><br>

 Ryan focused on the API basics including templating, routes, and modeling.  I focused on some specific features such as extending the models to take advantage of the administration module, and User model.  All in all, it was a great meetup!<br><br>
