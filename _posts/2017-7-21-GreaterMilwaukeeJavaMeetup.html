title: Hack & Tell - Brainstorm Session
---


<div class="D_bbcode">
Thanks to everyone who attended the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Greater-Milwaukee-Java-Meetup/events/241584055/">Hack & Tell - Brainstorm Session</a> @ <a href="https://www.digitalmeasures.com/">Digital Measures</a>.  I think it went really well.  I really enjoyed the open discussion, and sharing of ideas and side projects.  I'll schedule another session like this before the next Hack & Tell. <br><br>

Let me know if you liked having the brainstorming session on the same week as the Hack & Tell, or if you'd like it a week earlier to have more prep time between the meetup event, and the Hack & Tell event.<br><br>

Another big thanks to <a href="http://www.safenetconsulting.com">SafeNet Consulting</a>, whose sponsorship paid for the Raspberry PI.  Congrats to Trent Rogers, I hope you get a lot of good use out of it!  Another big thanks to <a href="https://www.digitalmeasures.com/">Digital Measures</a> for the space, and pizza.
Keep hacking!<br><br>
