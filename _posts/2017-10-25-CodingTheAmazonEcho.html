<div class="D_bbcode">
Thanks to all who attended <a href="https://www.meetup.com/preview/Greater-Milwaukee-Java-Meetup/events/243547502/">Coding the Amazon Echo</a> last night!  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adithya22/">Adithya Balasubramanian</a> did an awesome job showing the basics of creating an Alexa skill.  I went to Amazon.com and bought an Echo Dot when I got home.  Hopefully I'll have some time to make some useful skills to sahre!<br>
