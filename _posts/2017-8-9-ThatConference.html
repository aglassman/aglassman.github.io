title: That Conference - Graph Database Talk
---


<div class="D_bbcode">
I gave a talk at <a href="https://www.thatconference.com/">That Conference</a> this year titled <a href="https://www.thatconference.com/sessions/session/11447">Graph Databases - What Why How</a>.  This was my first conference talk, and I was a bit nervous about it.  Luckily the session attendees were awesome and had many great questions.  This helped the time fly by, and before I knew it my 60 minutes were up! <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JmwvKY7gS5Hcynw3yijeoSpqh-1zJCmdnSYs54whrDs/edit?usp=sharing">Slide deck for those interested.</a> <br><br>

This was my first year attending That Conference, and it was <a href="https://twitter.com/a_glassman/status/894915960653697024">very impressive.</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/csell5"> Clark Sells</a> did a killer job putting this even together. The kids had a blast at the water park.  Unfortunatly they were a bit young for the family sessions.  I think they will enjoy the conference aspect more once they are at least six years old.  <br><br>


All in all, I can't wait for That Conference 2018!
