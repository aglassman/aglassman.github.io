Thanks to everyone who attended the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Greater-Milwaukee-Java-Meetup/events/235904449/">Redis Workshop</a>. <br><br>

I think it went well considering this is the first time we've tried the workshop format.<br><br>

Here are the materials:<br><br>

Presentation: <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/156sNIo9jzVETF_gnxzWMOueuHzBZcvhA8t3X78C397M/edit?usp=sharing">Link (Google Slides)</a><br><br>

Contains:<br><br>

<ul>
<li>Redis Overview</li>
<li>Problem / Solution Description</li>
<li>Pivotal Web Services setup / deploy</li>
</ul><br><br>

Workshop Code: <a href="https://github.com/GreaterMKEMeetup/redis-workshop­">https://github.com/GreaterMKEMeetup/redis-workshop­</a><br><br>

Contains:<br>
<ol>
<li>Pre-solution code</li>
<li>Branch for Spring Data solution</li>
<li>Branch for Redisson solution</li>
<li>Spring Data solution branch also contains manifest.yml files for PWS deploys.</li>
</ol><br><br>

Improvements for next workshop style meetup:<br><br>

<ol>
<li>Omit Vagrant, and use Virtual Box directly.</li>
<li>Supply an image rather than having to pull and run Vagrant.</li>
<li>Pull code from inside the Virtual Machine to avoid differences in git configurations (windows line endings).</li>
</ol><br><br>
<p>
Thanks, and stay tuned for announcements on <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Greater-Milwaukee-Java-Meetup/events/235757499/">February's meetup @ MATC</a>.<br><br>
