<div class="D_bbcode">
Great crowd last night at the MilwaukeeJS meetup! <a href="https://www.meetup.com/milwaukeejs/events/233820934/">Rapid Innovation with Node-RED</a>!
Try out Node-RED, wire up some fun, innovative flows, and shoot me an email.  I'd love to see what you all come up with.  If you have any questions on how to get started, or get stuck, just shoot me a email, or meetup message.
